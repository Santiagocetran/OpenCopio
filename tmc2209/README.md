Integrating with Astronomy Software: INDI and KStars/Ekos
INDI (Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface) is a powerful framework specifically designed for astronomy equipment control. Here's a detailed explanation of how to integrate it with your Raspberry Pi and motor setup:
What is INDI?
INDI is an open-source protocol that allows control of astronomical equipment like telescopes, cameras, and focusers across different devices. It works through a client-server architecture where:

The INDI server runs on your Raspberry Pi and communicates directly with your hardware
INDI clients (like KStars/Ekos) can connect to your server locally or remotely
It provides standardized drivers for different types of astronomy equipment

Step 1: Install INDI Server on Raspberry Pi
bash# Update your system first
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# Install INDI core packages and common drivers
sudo apt install indi-full kstars-bleeding

# For just the minimal required packages
# sudo apt install indi-bin libindi-dev indi-basic
Step 2: Configure Your Custom Stepper Motor Driver
INDI doesn't have a specific driver for custom TMC2209 setups, so you have two options:
Option A: Use Generic INDI Drivers

Use the "INDI GPIO" driver for basic control:
bashsudo apt install indi-gpiodriver

Configure the GPIO pins in the INDI Control Panel to match your TMC2209 connections

Option B: Create a Custom INDI Driver (more advanced)

Install development tools:
bashsudo apt install build-essential cmake libindi-dev

Clone the INDI repository for reference:
bashgit clone https://github.com/indilib/indi.git

Create a custom driver based on existing telescope drivers in the repository

Step 3: Launch INDI Server
bash# Start INDI server with appropriate drivers
# Replace "indi_gpiodriver" with your driver name
indiserver -v indi_gpiodriver
Step 4: Connect with KStars/Ekos

Install KStars on your Raspberry Pi (or another computer on the same network):
bashsudo apt install kstars-bleeding

Launch KStars and open Ekos (Tools â†’ Ekos)
In Ekos, create a new profile:

Set Equipment Location to "Local"
Select the appropriate drivers for your mount
Configure communication settings


Connect to your INDI server:

In the "INDI Control Panel", select your driver
Configure the GPIO settings to match your hardware



Step 5: Create Telescope Configuration

In KStars, define your telescope mount parameters:

Mount type (Alt-Az, Equatorial)
Gear ratios, steps per revolution
Maximum slew rates


Calibrate your mount's position:

Use the alignment procedure in Ekos
Perform polar alignment if using an equatorial mount



Benefits of Using INDI

Planetarium Integration: Point and click on objects in KStars, and your telescope moves to them
Automated Observing: Schedule observation sequences
Plate Solving: Automatically correct pointing errors
Remote Control: Control your telescope from inside your house or even remotely
Data Collection: If you add a camera, automate imaging sequences

Example: Basic INDI+GPIO Config
Edit the INDI configuration file to connect your GPIO pins:
bashnano ~/.indi/indi_gpiodriver_sk.xml
Add configuration like:
xml<INDIDriver>
<newSwitchVector device="GPIO" name="CONNECTION">
  <oneSwitch name="CONNECT">On</oneSwitch>
  <oneSwitch name="DISCONNECT">Off</oneSwitch>
</newSwitchVector>
<newNumberVector device="GPIO" name="GPIO_PINS">
  <oneNumber name="STEP_PIN">21</oneNumber>
  <oneNumber name="DIR_PIN">20</oneNumber>
  <oneNumber name="ENABLE_PIN">16</oneNumber>
</newNumberVector>
</INDIDriver>
